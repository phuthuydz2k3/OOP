9. Constructors of whole classes and parent classes
- Which classes are aggregates of other classes? Checking all constructors of whole classes if they 
initialize for their parts?
	answer: CompactDisc, Cart, Store.
10. Unique item in a list
When overriding the equals() method of the Object class, you will have to cast the Object 
parameter obj to the type of Object that you are dealing with. For example, in the Media class, you 
must cast the Object obj to a Media, and then check the equality of the two objectsâ€™ attributes as the 
above requirements (i.e. title for Media; title and length for Track). If the passing object is 
not an instance of Media, what happens?
	answer: i use this code: 
	"if (!(obj instanceof Media))
        	{
            	return false;
        	}"
 	=> so in my case it will return false;
12. Sort media in the cart
- What class should implement the Comparable interface?
	answer: Media
- In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo()method be to reflect the ordering that we want?
	answer: i will show an example of how i will do it (in the case of compare cost):
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Media other)
    {
       	int costComparion = Float.compare(other.getCost(), this.getCost());

        if (costComparion != 0)
        {
            return costComparion;
        }
        else
        {
            return media1.getTitle().compareTo(media2.getTitle());
        }
    }

- Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach?
	answer: yes we can
- Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
	answer: i will give an example:
	@Override
    public int compareTo(Media other)
    {
	int titleComparion = this.getTitle().comapreTo(other.getTitle());
	int lengthComparion = Integer.compare(other.getLength(), this.getLength());
	int costComparion = Float.compare(other.getCost(), this.getCost());

        if (titleComparion != 0)
        {
            return costComparion;
        }
        else if (lengtComparion != 0)
	{
	    return lengthComparion;
	else
        {
            return costComparion;
        }
    }
